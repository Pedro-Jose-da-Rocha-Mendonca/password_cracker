# password_cracking

In this website, you will find a simulation that demonstrates password cracking techniques while incorporating a human-centered design that utilizes mental models to demonstrate how users typically create and manage passwords. The simulation allows users to input custom password parameters and see real-time attempts by the system to crack these passwords using various methods. By visualizing the process, the project aims to educate users on the vulnerabilities inherent in weak password practices and provide insights on how their mental models about password security might be flawed.

The technical aspect of the project focuses on the mechanisms of password cracking. The simulation models techniques such as brute force and dictionary attacks, highlighting how different algorithms and computational methods work to systematically test password combinations. By using a working prototype, the simulation provides a dynamic and interactive environment where users can observe the impact of password complexity and length on cracking time
